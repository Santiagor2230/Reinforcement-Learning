# Reinforcement-Learning

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

On this project we use methods of Deep Q-learning in order for an agent which in this case is a pirate to find the most efficient way of reaching the treasure which in this case is the goal. The code that I was given is the environment, the agents movements and experience replay, the code that I had to create is the application of the neural network into Q-learning, the greedy-epsilon so that the agent is able to explore, the application of experience replay in order for the agent to predict the best possible action.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists main duty is to analyze and develop software and hardware solutions into issues that others such as companies might need to have resolve and it matters because without computer scientist it will be hard to establish and maintain new technology in the modern world.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist I will begin approaching a problem by analyzing the needs of the issue and identifying if these needs are realistic, then developing a plan to apply a solution to the problem, later we apply the plan to see if any flaws appear, we initiate the clensing of the flaws and finally we set the solution into motion.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical reponsibilities to the end user and the organization is to be transparent of my work, complete task efficiently and on time, make sure that the work I do does not negatively affect the end user as well as the organization and finally ensure to keep things in a professional manner.
